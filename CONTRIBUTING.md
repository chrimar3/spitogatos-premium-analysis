## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Python 3.8 or higher
python --version

# Git for version control
git --version
```

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/chrimar3/spitogatos-premium-analysis.git
cd spitogatos-premium-analysis

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run basic analysis to verify setup
python analyzers/sqm_energy_correlation_analyzer.py
```

### Development Dependencies
```bash
# Install additional development tools
pip install pytest black flake8 mypy jupyter
```

## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style
- **Follow PEP 8** style guidelines
- **Use meaningful variable names**
- **Add docstrings** to all functions and classes
- **Include type hints** where appropriate
- **Limit line length** to 88 characters (Black formatter)

### Example Function Format
```python
def analyze_energy_correlation(df: pd.DataFrame, confidence_level: float = 0.95) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """
    Calculate correlation between property size and energy efficiency.
    
    Args:
        df: DataFrame containing property data with 'sqm' and 'energy_class' columns
        confidence_level: Statistical confidence level for analysis (default: 0.95)
    
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing correlation coefficients and p-values
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If required columns are missing from DataFrame
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Data Analysis Guidelines
- **Validate all input data** before analysis
- **Include confidence intervals** for statistical results
- **Document assumptions** and limitations
- **Preserve data provenance** (source, timestamp, extraction method)

## üîç Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_analyzers.py

# Run with coverage report
python -m pytest --cov=. tests/
```

### Writing Tests
- **Test all public functions**
- **Include edge cases** and error conditions
- **Use descriptive test names**
- **Mock external dependencies** (web scraping, file I/O)

### Example Test
```python
def test_energy_correlation_calculation():
    """Test correlation calculation with known data."""
    # Arrange
    test_data = pd.DataFrame({
        'sqm': [50, 100, 150],
        'energy_class': ['C', 'B', 'A']
    })
    
    # Act
    result = analyze_energy_correlation(test_data)
    
    # Assert
    assert 'correlation' in result
    assert -1 <= result['correlation'] <= 1
    assert 'p_value' in result
```

## üìä Data Contribution Guidelines

### Data Quality Standards
- **Authenticity**: All data must be from real, verifiable sources
- **Completeness**: Core fields (price, sqm, energy_class) must be present
- **Accuracy**: Data should reflect current market conditions
- **Provenance**: Include source URL and extraction timestamp

### Adding New Data Sources
1. **Document the source** (platform, URL, access method)
2. **Create extraction script** following existing patterns
3. **Implement validation** for data quality
4. **Add tests** for the new data pipeline
5. **Update documentation** with new source details

### Data Privacy
- **No personal information** (owner names, contact details)
- **Aggregate data only** for public analysis
- **Respect platform terms of service**
- **Follow ethical scraping practices**

## üî¨ Analysis Contribution Guidelines

### Statistical Rigor
- **Use appropriate statistical methods** for the data type
- **Report confidence intervals** for all estimates
- **Test for statistical significance**
- **Document methodological choices**

### Reproducibility Requirements
- **Include all code** for analysis
- **Document random seeds** for reproducible results
- **Provide sample data** for testing
- **Version control all changes**

### New Analysis Types
1. **Propose the analysis** in an issue first
2. **Discuss methodology** with maintainers
3. **Implement with tests** and documentation
4. **Validate results** against existing analyses
